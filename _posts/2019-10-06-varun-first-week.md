> Started from **nothing** and now I know how to make a static webpage in Github using Jekyll and Markdown, here's how i went about it.
> First learned the basics of Creating and hosting a page on Github using [Guide to hosting on Github](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
>
>This was my [first attempt at the page](https://varunversion1.github.io) basically adapting the tutorial to my needs.
>
>Downloaded [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) for editing website offline or on the go. Also got [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) for editing my text.
>
> Next i used [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to learn the basics of Markdown. Markdown is very easy to learn but it can only be used for very specific things.
> 
> Created a [CV page](https://varunversion1.github.io/cv/) and inserted a picture of my face 
>![](/Images/Week01/Face.jpg)
>
>Created a hyperlink to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-ramesh-4a278059/) for the CV page.

> Here are some of the challenges i faced along the way
>
> * Markdown not playing well with Jekyll - all the code just showed up as is on the site. Discussed with mentor regarding this.
>
    * **Solution** - Turns out the file extension was .html ![](/Images/Week01/Html.png) which didnt play well with markdown. Renamed the file extension from .html to .md ![](/Images/Week01/md.png) and then it started working
>
> * Tried to get LinkedIn profile to open in a new tab.
>
    * **Solution** - Markdown doesn't allow this so after going through various stackoverflow and other sites for a solution realised there is no simple solution for this yet.
